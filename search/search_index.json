It consists of a suite of business-oriented ad hoc queries and concurrent data modifications. The queries and the data populating the database have been chosen to have broad industry-wide relevance. This benchmark illustrates decision support systems that examine large volumes of data, execute queries with a high degree of complexity, and give answers to critical business questions.\u201d For more information, see TPC-H specifications . This article describes how to use Compute Nest to quickly deploy the resources required for this service. Deployment architecture: Billing instructions The cost of this service in computing nest deployment mainly involves: AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL Instance Traffic bandwidth charges ECS Instance Permissions required Deploying this service instance requires accessing and creating some Alibaba Cloud resources. Therefore, your account needs to include permissions for the following resources. Note : You only need to add this permission when your account is a RAM account. Permission policy name Remarks AliyunECSFullAccess Permission to manage cloud server service (ECS) AliyunVPCFullAccess Permission to manage private network (VPC) AliyunROSFullAccess Permission to manage Resource Orchestration Service (ROS) AliyunGPDBFullAccess Permission to manage AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL (GPDB) AliyunComputeNestUserFullAccess Manage user-side permissions for the ComputeNest service (ComputeNest) Deployment process Deployment parameter Parameter Explanation Service Instance Name The name can be up to 64 characters in length, and can contain digits, letters, hyphens (-), and underscores (_). The name must start with a letter. Region The region where the service instance is deployed. Instance Charge Type Charge type for the service instance.
